Repo for challenge 12


This challenge has tasked me with clasifying risky & healthy loans & determining the worthiness of borrowers. To do this we compare two different machine learning applications to determine which has the best performence metrics. 

First, we read in the data, split it into test & train, & a regression model is instantiated. 

We then instantiate a new model with RandomOverSampler utilized. 

Finally we can compare & contrast the accuracy of each using their respective accuracy scores, confusion matrixs, & classification reports.
